You are the villain


.. and goats


Thinking / sleeping.

OK

You're a Dracula-type dude.
You've ordered a million ghosts
for your scary mansion, but end
up being delivered a million
-goats-.

Now you must gather them in a
bobble-esque game.

They are fainting goats, so by scaring
them they fall onto their back and you
can collect.

The goats do not hurt the Dracula Dude

Need some hazards / enemies.

* Ultra-generic Vampire Hunters
	* ... and their dogs?

* Environmental hazards

* Time limit / Resource limit

Bonus (bonus stage?) if possible to
add more villainy ... 

Bonus if time to ditch sdl-ttf and do
bitmap font

Coffee
